# Lumis-Roblox-Functions
A set of special functions that I made for my first Roblox game (Five Nights at Evil Leafy's), now expanded for public use!

Hi. I don't know how to code. This is a set of functions I made for use in Roblox games, I originally made them for my own project but I've decided to publish them for others to use. (this is my first time using github I have no idea how any of this works yikes forgive me)

## ChatMulti
For creating chat commmands.

## Key
